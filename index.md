title: Summary

I build and maintain open source software for Python’s data science ecosystem.
This is part of a broader effort to increase accessibility to computation,
accelerate science, and enable more informed policy decisions.


### Work

I coordinate and maintain several libraries within Python’s numeric computing
ecosystem, particularly around efficient and scalable computing.

I am primarily known for my work on [Dask](https://dask.org), a library for
scalable computing with dynamic task scheduling.  Dask combines a high-speed
task scheduler with parallel algorithms to scale existing Python libraries like
Numpy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.

More generally though I work with other core developers within the ecosystem to
promote the general health and efficiency. I contribute to and maintain dozens
of libraries. A more complete record of my contribution is available on GitHub:

I write frequently about my work at [matthewrocklin.com/blog](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog).
